For further information, see the terms of use and privacy policy of Apple’s App Store and Google Play as well as any other applicable terms and conditions appearing on the website of the respective provider.

To facilitate the processing of donations from the User, Givt has entered into an agreement with ipagoo llp, an Electronic Money Institution, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN 900122) (“ipagoo”)(the \"Processor\"). Givt will, after the collection of donations, ensure the payment of donations to the user-designated beneficiary. The transaction data will be processed and forwarded to the Givt Processor. The Processor will initiate payment transactions whereas Givt is responsible for the transaction of the relevant amounts to the bank account of the Church/Charity as being the user-designated beneficiary of the donation.\n\n4.2 \tThe User agrees that Givt may pass the User’s (transaction and bank) data to the Processor, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to enable the Processor to initiate the payment transactions and processing. Givt reserves the right to change the Processor at any time. The User agrees that Givt may forward the relevant information and data about the User as defined in article 4.2 to the new Processor to be able to continue processing payment transactions. \n\n4.3 \tGivt and the Processor will process the data of the User in accordance with the law and regulations that applies to data protection. For further information on how personal data is collected, processed and used, Givt refers the User to its privacy policy. This can be found at: (www.givtapp.net/en-gb/privacystatementgivt-service/).\n\n4.4 \tThe donations of the User will pass through Givt as anintermediary. Givt will ensure that the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary, with whom Givt has an agreement. \n\n4.5 \tThe User can reverse a debit at any time, within the terms of the User's bank, and the direct debit scheme. \n\n4.6 \tGivt and/or the Processor can refuse a donation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a user is acting in violation of these terms or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a donation is possibly suspicious or illegal. In this case Givt will inform the User as soon as possible, unless prohibited by law. \n\n4.7 \tDonations with Givt are subject to the following limits: GBP 1000 per donation and GBP 25000 per calendar year.\n\n4.8 \tThe User agrees that Givt may pass transactional data of the User to the HMRC, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to assist the User with their annual tax return.   \n\n4.9\tWe will hold your money in a Payment Account, provided by ipagoo. The Payment Account is designated as a “Client Funds Account” and segregated from our own assets. The money contained in the Client Funds Account cannot be used by Givt, invested or lent to third parties, or in any way form part of Givt’s assets.\n\n4.10\tCurrent Regulatory Provisions exclude money placed on a Payment Account from the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\n\n4.11\tMoney placed or held in the Client Funds Account shall not constitute a deposit (within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive 2006/48/EC) and does not earn interest.\n4.12\tDeposits and, in particular, withdrawals from the Client Funds Account will only be made in the following circumstances:\n\nIn the case of deposits:\n\nTo receive money intended for onward payment to the designated charity/charities or church(es)\nTo replenish the account where fees or other costs associated with running the account have been deducted\nTo receive refunds in the event that prior instruction to make a payment by you is cancelled, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions\n\nIn the case of withdrawals:\n\nTo pay designated charities and churches, in accordance with your instructions\nTo pay fees or other costs associated with running the account\nTo return money to you, in the event that prior instruction to make a payment by you is cancelled, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.\n\n5. \tSecurity, theft and loss \n\n5.1 \tThe User shall take all reasonable precautions safekeeping their login credentials for Givt to avoid loss, theft, misappropriation or unauthorised use of Givt on their device.\n\n5.2 \tThe User is responsible for the security of their device. Givt considers any donation from the Givt account as a user-approved transaction, regardless of the rights of the User under article 4.5.\n\n5.3 \tThe User shall inform Givt immediately via info@givt.app or +44 20 3790 8068 once their device is lost or stolen. Upon receipt of a message Givt will block the account to prevent (further) misuse. \n\n6.\tUpdates\n\n6.1\tGivt releases updates from time to time, which can rectify errors or improve the functionality of Givt. Available updates for Givt will be announced by means of notification through Apple’s App Store and Google Play and it is the User’s sole responsibility to monitor these notifications and keep informed about new updates.\n\n6.2\tAn update can stipulate conditions, which differ from the provisions in this agreement. The User will always be notified in advance so that they have the opportunity to refuse the update. By installing such an update, the User agrees to these new conditions, which will then form part of this agreement. If User does not agree to the changed conditions, they will have to cease using Givt and delete Givt from their device.\n\n7. \tLiability \n\n7.1 \tGivt has been compiled with the utmost care. Although Givt strives to make Givt available 24 hours a day, it accepts no liability if, for any reason, Givt is not available at any given time or for a certain period of time. Givt reserves the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue Givt (unannounced). The User cannot derive any rights from this. \n\n7.2 \tGivt is not liable for damage or injury resulting from the use of Givt. The limitations of liability as mentioned in this article shall lapse if the liability for damage is the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of Givt.\n\n7.3 \tThe User indemnifies Givt against any claim from third parties (for example, beneficiaries of the donations or HMRC) as a result of the use of the Givt or not correctly meeting the agreements made concerning legal or contractual obligations with Givt. The User will pay all damages and costs to Givt as a result of such claims.\n\n8. \tOther provisions \n\n8.1 \tThis agreement comes into effect on commencement of the use of Givt and will remain in force for an undetermined period from that moment. This agreement may be terminated by the User as well as by Givt at any moment, subject to one month’s notice. This agreement will end by operation of law in the event you are declared bankrupt, you apply for a moratorium on payments or a general attachment is levied against your assets, in the event of your death, or in the event you go into liquidation, are wound up or dissolved. Following the termination of this agreement (for whatever reason), you shall cease and desist from all further use of Givt. You must then delete all copies (including back-up copies) of Givt from all your devices.\n\n8.2\tIf any provision of these terms and conditions is void or destroyed, this will not affect the validity of the agreement as a whole, and other provisions of these terms remain in force. In that case, the parties will decide on a new replacement provision or provisions which will be in line with the intention of the original agreement as far as is legally possible.\n\n8.3 \tThe User is not allowed to transfer the rights and/or obligations arising from the use of Givt and these terms to third parties without prior written permission of Givt. Conversely, Givt is allowed to do so. \n\n8.4 \tWe will endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably. Any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms and conditions are finally settled in the Courts of England and Wales. \n\n8.5  \tThe Law of England and Wales is applicable on these terms of use. \n\n8.6 \tThe terms of use shall not affect the User's statutory rights as a consumer.\n\n8.7 \tGivt features an internal complaints procedure. Givt handles complaints efficiently and as soon as reasonably possible. Any complaint about the implementation of these conditions by Givt must be submitted in writing at Givt (via support@givt.app).\n";

Givt B.V. is not a bank/financial institution and does not provide banking or\npayment processor services. To facilitate the processing of donations from\nthe User, Givt B.V. has entered into an agreement with a payment service\nprovider called SlimPay. SlimPay is a financial institution (the \"Processor\")\nwith which it was agreed that Givt B.V. sends the transaction information to\nthe Processor in order to initiate and to handle donations. Givt B.V. will,\nafter the collection of donations, ensure the payment of donations to the\nuser-designated beneficiary. The transaction data will be processed and\nforwarded to the Givt Processor.

The User agrees that Givt B.V. may pass the User’s (transaction and bank)\ndata to the Processor, along with all other necessary account and personal\ninformation of the User, in order to enable the Processor to initiate the\npayment transactions and processing.

Givt B.V.t\nconsiders any donation from the Givt account as a user-approved\ntransaction, regardless of the rights of the User under article 4.5.\n\n5.3. The User shall inform Givt B.V. immediately via info@givt.app or +31 320\n320 115 once their smartphone is lost or stolen. Upon receipt of a message\nGivt B.V. will block the account to prevent (further) misuse.\n\n6. Updates\n\n6.1. Givt B.V. releases updates from time to time, which can rectify errors or\nimprove the functionality of Givt. Available updates for Givt will be\nannounced by means of notification through Apple’s App Store and Google\nPlay and it is the User’s sole responsibility to monitor these notifications and\nkeep informed about new updates.\n\n6.2. An update can stipulate conditions, which differ from the provisions in this\nagreement. This will always be notified to the User in advance so that they\nhave the opportunity to refuse the update. By installing such an update, the\nUser agrees to these new conditions, which will then form part of this\nagreement. If User does not agree to the changed conditions, they have to\ncease using Givt and have to delete Givt from their device.\n\n7. Liability\n\n7.1. Givt has been compiled with the utmost care. Although Givt B.V. strives to\nmake Givt available 24 hours a day, it accepts no liability if, for any reason,\nGivt is not available at any given time or for a certain period of time. Givt\nB.V. reserves the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue Givt\n(unannounced). The User cannot derive any rights from this.\n\n7.2. Givt B.V. is not liable for damage or injury resulting from the use of Givt. The\nlimitations of liability as mentioned in this article shall lapse if the liability for\ndamage is the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of Givt B.V.\n\n7.3. The User indemnifies Givt B.V. against any claim from third parties (for\nexample, beneficiaries of the donations or the tax authority) as a result of\nthe use of the Givt or not correctly meeting the agreements made\nconcerning legal or contractual obligations with Givt B.V. The User will pay\nall damages and costs to Givt B.V. as a result of such claims.\n\n8. Other provisions\n\n8.1. This agreement comes into effect on commencement of the use of Givt and\nwill remain in force for an undetermined period from that moment. This\nagreement may be terminated by the User as well as by Givt B.V. at any\nmoment, subject to one month’s notice. This agreement will end by\noperation of law in the event you are declared bankrupt, you apply for a\nmoratorium on payments or a general attachment is levied against your\nassets, in the event of your death, or in the event you go into liquidation, are\nwound up or dissolved. Following the termination of this agreement (for\nwhatever reason), you shall cease and desist from all further use of Givt. You\nmust then delete all copies (including back-up copies) of Givt from all your\ndevices.\n\n8.2. If any provision of these terms and conditions is void or destroyed, this will\nnot affect the validity of the agreement as a whole, and other provisions of\nthese terms remain in force. In that case, the parties will decide on a new\nreplacement provision or provisions which will be in line with the intention\nof the original agreement as far as is legally possible.\n\n8.3. The User is not allowed to transfer the rights and/or obligations arising from\nthe use of Givt and these terms to third parties without prior written\npermission of Givt B.V. Conversely, Givt B.V. is allowed to do so.\n\n8.4. Any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms are finally\nsettled in the Court of Lelystad. Before the dispute will be referred to court,\nwe will endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably.\n\n\n8.5. The Dutch law is applicable on these terms of use.\n\n8.6. The terms of use shall not affect the User's statutory rights as a consumer.\n\n8.7. Givt B.V. features an internal complaints procedure.

Using Givt feels as natural as giving cash. \n\nWhy 'Givt'?\nThe name Givt was chosen because it is about ‘giving’ as well as giving a ‘gift’. We were looking for a modern and compact name that looks friendly and playful. In our logo you might notice that the green bar combined with the letter ‘v’ forms the shape of an offering bag, which gives an idea of the function. \n\nThe Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom\nThere is a team of specialists behind Givt, divided over the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom.
